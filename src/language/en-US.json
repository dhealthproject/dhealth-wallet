    "faq_answer_tokenomics_2": "DHP has a fixed maximum supply of 2 billion tokens. At public chain release, the supply consists of 1 billion DHP and another billion will be created as Blockrewards over the period of 10 epochs. dHealth Network rewards will be released to each block creator based on a POS+ (Proof of Stake+) system.",
    "faq_answer_tokenomics_3": "The dHealth Network is a self-sustaining economic ecosystem involving DHP token holders, Supernode operators, and organizations that are applying use-cases. In this way, it’s similar to many decentralized blockchains, but there are important differences that make it easier for anyone to earn rewards.<br/>An initial DHP token distribution is achieved by allocating DHP via Airdrop to the NEM community, DHP sale, and early supporters as well as team members. The DHP holders can sell and buy DHP via centralized exchanges and a decentralized Automated Market Maker (AMM).<br/>Supernodes and their operators secure and enable the dHealth Network and its use cases in which individuals and organizations holding DHP are participating. Supernodes receive Block Rewards for creating new blocks and transaction fees and distribute it to the DHP holders that staked on the Supernode. Supernode operators can deduct a fee from the rewards and fees. The Innovation Fund has an initial supply of 400 million DHP and is also fed by fees from the Block Reward. A maximum of 40 million DHP is allocated per epoch from to the Innovation Fund to support Use Cases that generate transactions on the dHealth Network.",
    "faq_answer_tokenomics_4": "dHealth Network’s blocks are confirmed every 30 seconds, therefore rewards are frequent. Block rewards consist of inflation rewards and transaction fees. The chances of earning a block reward are based mainly on the operator’s DHP stake, as well as other factors like network activity. Both node operators and anyone else with a DHP wallet can earn block rewards. The higher an account’s DHP balance, the higher the chance of it earning a block reward. Even those who do not run a node can earn block rewards by delegating their stake to a node.<br/><br />dHealth Network’s inflation is going to last for 12.5 million blocks (total of 4,340 days). Halving takes place every 1.25 million blocks (1 epoch = 434 days).

    "faq_answer_tokenomics_5": "DHP owners who don’t operate nodes can also earn block rewards by delegating their stake to a node. Holders who delegate their stake retain full ownership of their DHP and never expose their private keys. When delegated harvesters earn a block reward, the node operator who processed it earns 10% and the delegated harvester earns 90%. This is the default setting that can be modified for each node by the respective node operator. In this way, a node operator can increase their earned rewards, and all holders can participate in rewards whether or not they run a node.",
    "faq_answer_tokenomics_6": "Node operators can set their own minimum fees for which they wish to process transactions.
